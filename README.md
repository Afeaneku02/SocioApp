# SocioApp: Neural Networks to Detect Sociability
## Introduction
SocioApp is an application designed to track the sociability of users and provide feedback on their social interactions. 
The aim is to help students improve their academic performance and mental health by encouraging more physical social interactions within the university. 
The application uses machine learning algorithms to analyze audio data and determine the social status of the users.

## Motivation
Students' performance is largely influenced by their mental health. Social interactions can ease students' pressure and improve their academic performance and confidence. 
SocioApp targets physical social interactions to help students communicate more effectively and frequently with peers, friends, and faculty.

## Features
- Tracks and analyzes users' social interactions.
- Provides feedback on sociability.
- Uses neural networks for speaker identification.
- Encourages physical social interactions to enhance academic performance.

## Workflow
1.) Audio data collection
- Collect audio voice recordings from particpants using a Pixel 4a device.

2.) Extract Data
- Use a python script to extract data.
- convert audio files into '.flac' format.
- convert '.flac' files into features ('.plk').

3.) Train the Neural Network
- Evaluate the model's accuracy in distinguishing between speakers.

4.) Evaluate the Model
- The accuracy of the model in deciphering between speakrs will output in a chart for us to see the results
- Output the results in a chart to visualize the model's performance.


## Future work 
- Collect larger datasets from diverse backgrounds.
- Improve neural network models for more precise speaker identification.
- Develop models to detect and correlate human activities.
- Create a metric to measure sociability.
